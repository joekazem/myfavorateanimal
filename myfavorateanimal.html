    <p>The Burmese cat is an extremely friendly and affectionate creature that needs attention from human beings to be happy. The Burmese cat breed is very demanding and Burmese cats will follow owners around the house crying for attention – they might even climb their owner's leg begging to be picked up and cuddled! As very vocal cats they will often greet owners when they return home or demand what they want and to join in with all activities. Loyal to their owners, they are sometimes known as the 'dog cat' as many are happy to play retrieve. They are very intelligent and can work out problems such as opening doors are often successful escape artists! Because of their surprising weight, the Burmese are often referred to as a “brick wrapped in silk” . These cats are known for being rather clingy, and seem to possess many dog-like qualities. One of these qualities is that they don’t like to be left alone. They have a very naturally trusting nature and tend to be very clingy. Fun fact: despite the name of the breed, the Burmese that we know today were actually bred here in the United States.</p>
